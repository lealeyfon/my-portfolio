## Requirements
1. Use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px` for each stylesheet.
2. Make the layout match the following screenshots:
  * `index.html`: [980px], [768px], [640px]
  * `portfolio.html`: [980px], [768px], [640px]
  * `contact.html`: [980px], [768px]), [640px]

3. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; I don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of my site.

4. Included the `viewport` tag in all my HTML files, otherwise my media-queries wouldn't function as expected on mobile devices.
