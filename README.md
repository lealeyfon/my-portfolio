#My Portfolio
  
I am going to talk trough my code basically listing every element and saying what its use is in my html
 ## Head yag
 The head element is a container for all the head elements. The head element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more. The following elements can go inside the head element:
*title ( This is the Name of the page you are going to see at the top of the browser) 
*style (the style The style tag is used to define style information for an HTML document.Inside the style element you specify how HTML elements should render in a browser.Each HTML document can contain multiple style tags)
*link(The link tag defines a link between a document and an external resource.The link tag is used to link to external style sheets e.g. in our case we linked the styled sheet to the html because its on an external file)
*meta
(Metadata is data (information) about data.The meta tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata.The metadata can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services.)
*script
(The script tag is used to define a JavaScript. The script element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.)

## Body
This is where every thing we can see when we open our browser goes in to. In our body tag, the first element we used is the header tag. the header represent the top part we see in our browser. It usually contains links to other pages and in our case it contains the about, portfolio and contact links, which when we click on this link we are going to het into anoter page. It is also good to note that the header is a container

Then we have our Nav bar. Its the short form for navigation. this is were we fine our navigation links i.e. links to other html

The section come write after the header. the section is similar to the header in that its just a container. This is where we put our main conntent where the person going through our website is going to be interested in. In our section we have  a H1 tag which represents the most important header in our page. the the img tag which stands for image. this is where we wrap our image for it to be visible on the browser. The image could come from a local source as in our case or it could come from the internet. 

Right after our image tag, we have the p tag, which represents paragraphs. 

The footer tag defines a footer for our document. And in our footer we can fine our copyright information
